# Explainable GenAI for Biomolecules

Deep learning pipeline for protein function prediction and DNA binding site interpretation, combining transfer learning with explainable AI for drug discovery applications.

## Overview

This project demonstrates two complementary approaches to applying generative AI in computational biology:

1. **Protein Function Prediction**: Transfer learning with ESM-2 embeddings for multi-label GO term classification
2. **DNA Binding Interpretation**: Explainable CNN models with in silico mutagenesis for transcription factor binding sites
